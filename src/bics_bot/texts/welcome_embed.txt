### What awaits you in this server?
In this server you will be able to find other MICS students, discuss course related material and much more!

### Getting Started
**1.** In order to get granted the full server access, you will need to get a role which corresponds to your position in MICS. This can be the year you are in or for example if you are an erasmus/incoming student.

To get the role head to the **#💡｜getting-started** text channel and type `/intro` which is a bot command. Then fill in the available fields, such as your **first name**, **last name** and **year**. *(In case you are an erasmus/global exchange student choose **erasmus** as the year. In case you are planning on comming to the university choose **Incoming**)*

**2.** In case you have any questions, feel free to ask any of the @Moderator, or use the dedicated text channel #❓help.

**3.** Enjoy🙃

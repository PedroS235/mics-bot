## Course Text Channels Enrollment/Unenrollment
This server uses a system to mangage text channels for courses. The system is based on the concept of **enrollment** and **unenrollment**.
This allows you to view the text channles for the courses you are taking or will be taking. _Note that this is not a replacement for the course registration system in **Guichet Etudiant**)

## How To Use The System?
The concept is extremely basic. Once you are aware of the courses you will be taking or are already taking, you can use the command '/enroll' to join the text channels for those courses.
You can use the command "/unenroll" if you want to do the opposite, say due to an error.

_Note that you are always free to use the command at any given time._
